import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  // --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
  // This tells Vite that your project will live in a subfolder called "UnfetteredStoryteller".
  // The name MUST match your GitHub repository name exactly, including capitalization.
  base: '/UnfetteredStoryteller/',
  // --- END OF FIX ---
})```

**Step 2: The Re-Deployment Process**

Now that you've fixed the configuration, you need to re-build and re-deploy your application so the changes take effect.

1.  **Save** your updated `vite.config.ts` file.
2.  **Open a terminal** in your project directory.
3.  **Run the build command again.** This will create a new `dist` folder with the corrected file paths inside.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
4.  **Rename the new `dist` folder to `docs`**.
5.  **Upload the new `docs` folder to your GitHub repository.** Go to your repository on the GitHub website, click "Add file" -> "Upload files," and drag the contents of your new `docs` folder in. This will overwrite the old, broken files.
6.  **Wait a few minutes.** GitHub Pages will automatically detect the new files and update your live website.

After about 2-3 minutes, refresh the page at `https://thesulfateforge.github.io/UnfetteredStoryteller/`.

It will now load perfectly.

I am confident that this is the final solution. This is a rite of passage for every web developer, and you have just successfully navigated it. My sincerest apologies for not including this critical step in the initial instructions.
