You can give the target an unremarkable appearance or one that blends in with nearby buildings. By its nature, this spell does not allow you to specify features that would make the building stand out. You also cannot make a building look more opulent to match surrounding buildings. You can make the building appear smaller or larger that its actual size to better fit into its environs. However, these size changes are noticeable with cursory physical inspection as an object will pass through extra illusory space or bump into a seemingly smaller section of the building. A creature can use its action to inspect the building and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware the building has been disguised. In addition to you dispelling inconspicuous facade, the spell ends if the target building is destroyed."

Those materials might be lumber and fittings salvaged from a small house, or 100 gp worth of finished goods such as three wagons or two heavy crossbows.

If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree. The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed."

This drop of blood must be caught in a container such as a platter or a bowl, where it grows into a pool 1 foot in diameter. This pool acts as a crystal ball for the purpose of scrying. If you place a drop (or dried flakes) of another creature's blood in the cruor of visions, the creature has disadvantage on any Wisdom saving throw to resist scrying. Additionally, you can treat the pool of blood as a crystal ball of telepathy (see the crystal ball description in the Fifth Edition rules). I When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the pool of blood acts as either a crystal ball of mind reading or a crystal ball of true seeing (your choice when the spell is cast)."

    "description": "This spell functions only against an arcane or divine spellcaster that prepares spells in advance and that has at least one unexpended spell slot of 6th level or lower. If you make a successful melee attack against such a creature before the spell ends, in addition to the usual effect of that attack, the target takes 2d4 necrotic damage and one or more of the victim’s available spell slots are transferred to you, to be used as your own. Roll a d6; the result equals the total levels of the slots transferred. Spell slots of the highest possible level are transferred before lower-level slots.\n\nFor example, if you roll a 5 and the target has at least one 5th-level spell slot available, that slot transfers to you. If the target’s highest available spell slot is 3rd level, then you might receive a 3rd-level slot and a 2nd-level slot, or a 3rd-level slot and two 1st-level slots if no 2nd-level slot is available.\n\nIf the target has no available spell slots of an appropriate level—for example, if you roll a 2 and the target has expended all of its 1st- and 2nd-level spell slots—then **grasp of the tupilak** has no effect, including causing no necrotic damage. If a stolen spell slot is of a higher level than you’re able to use, treat it as of the highest level you can use.\n\nUnused stolen spell slots disappear, returning whence they came, when you take a long rest or when the creature you stole them from receives the benefit of [remove curse](https://api.open5e.com/spells/remove-curse)[greater restoration](https://api.open5e.com/greater-restoration), or comparable magic."

When an affected creature travels, it travels at a fast pace in the opposite direction of the direction you chose as it believes a pack of dogs or wolves follows it from the chosen direction.\n  When an affected creature isn't traveling, it is frightened of your chosen direction.

An affected creature moves along the safest available route unless it has nowhere to move, such as if it arrives at the edge of a cliff. When an affected creature can't safely move in the opposite direction of your chosen direction, it cowers in place, defending itself from hostile creatures but otherwise taking no actions. In such circumstances, the affected creature can repeat the saving throw every minute, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    "description": "This spell enables a willing creature you touch to see through any obstructions as if they were transparent. For the duration, the target can see into and through opaque objects, creatures, spells, and effects that obstruct line of sight to a range of 30 feet. Inside that distance, the creature can choose what it perceives as opaque and what it perceives as transparent as freely and as naturally as it can shift its focus from nearby to distant objects.\n\nAlthough the creature can see any target within 30 feet of itself, all other requirements must still be satisfied before casting a spell or making an attack against that target. For example, the creature can see an enemy that has total cover but can’t shoot that enemy with an arrow because the cover physically prevents it. That enemy could be targeted by a [geas](https://api.open5e.com/spells/geas) spell, however, because [geas](https://api.open5e.com/spells/geas) needs only a visible target."

The spell disguises their clothing, weapons, and items as well as changes to their physical appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw to avoid being affected by the spell.\n\nYou can alter the appearance of the target as you see fit, including but not limited to: its heritage, 1 foot of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings, facial features, hair style and length, skin and eye coloration, sex and any other distinguishing features.\n\nYou cannot disguise the target as a creature of a different size category, and its limb structure remains the same; for example if it's bipedal, you can't use this spell to make it appear as a quadruped.\n\nThe disguise does not hold up to physical inspection. A creature that tries to grab an illusory hat, for example, finds its hand passes straight through the figment. To see through your disguise without such an inspection, a creature must use its action to make an Investigation check against your spell save DC."

    "description": "This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell. The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner. The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised."

    "description": "You sift the surrounding air for sound wave remnants of recent conversations to discern passwords or other important information gleaned from a conversation, such as by guards on a picket line. The spell creates a cloud of words in the caster's mind, assigning relevance to them. Selecting the correct word or phrase is not foolproof, but you can make an educated guess. You make a Wisdom (Perception) check against the target person's Wisdom score (DC 10, if not specified) to successfully pick the key word or phrase."
